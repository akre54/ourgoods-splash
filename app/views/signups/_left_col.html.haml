    What's between you and your artistic goals? Want to some help getting from here to there from your peers?

    An Idea Party is simple: Six artists sit in a circle. Each artist names a challenge they are working on, and the group brainstorms resources to meet that challenge. Whether you need help refining an idea, access to space or equipment, a connection to a welder or web designer, or information about places where your work can thrive, you can find it at an Idea Party.

    This simple but powerful format has helped artists in every discipline and at every career level: "Suddenly you are surrounded by strangers who want to help, and who can and do."
